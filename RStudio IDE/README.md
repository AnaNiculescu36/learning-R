## Important 

- restart your session often with Session / Restart R or Ctrl-Shift-F10
- Useful shortcuts:
    + Ctrl-I to re-indent the line
    + Ctrl-/ to comment the line (custom, re-mapped!)
    + review all of the shortcuts with Alt-Shift-K
- [Multiple Cursors](https://blog.rstudio.org/2015/05/06/rstudio-v0-99-preview-more-editor-enhancements/) are very useful
